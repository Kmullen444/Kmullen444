# Hi! My name is Kevin Mullen.
## Welcome to my Github profile

Since the pandemic hit in 2020, I decided it was time for a bit of a change.
Having a love for problem solving and learning, software development seemed like
a prefect choice. So I've brougth the skills I've cultivated from years of working
in fine dining restaurants over and have beening having a blast ever since.

### So come on in and have a look around.
